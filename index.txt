If you want, I can combine all these pipelines and freestyle steps into a single, ready-to-copy “SE Lab Cheat Sheet” in the exact order you should perform them, so you can just follow it during the lab.
Do you want me to do that?




Perfect! Let’s forget all the theory and do a **step-by-step, practical “do this, see this” guide** for **Minikube + Nagios** so you can literally follow commands and be exam-ready.

I’ll assume you are **starting from scratch** on a Windows or Mac machine with Docker installed.

---

# **PART 1: MINIKUBE (Kubernetes)**

### **Step 0: Make sure Docker is running**

```bash
docker --version
docker ps
```

* If Docker is running, you will see its version and running containers.

---

### **Step 1: Start Minikube**

```bash
minikube start --driver=docker
```

* This starts a **mini Kubernetes cluster** on your laptop.
* Verify it’s running:

```bash
minikube status
```

* Optional: open dashboard:

```bash
minikube dashboard
```

* You will see a visual interface showing your cluster.

---

### **Step 2: Deploy Nginx**

```bash
kubectl create deployment mynginx --image=nginx
```

* Checks if deployment is created:

```bash
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods
```

---

### **Step 3: Expose Nginx to browser**

```bash
kubectl expose deployment mynginx --type=NodePort --port=80
```

* Find URL:

```bash
minikube service mynginx --url
```

* Open URL in browser → You should see Nginx welcome page.

---

### **Step 4: Scale Deployment**

```bash
kubectl scale deployment mynginx --replicas=4
kubectl get pods
```

* Now you have **4 pods** running Nginx.

---

### **Step 5: Stop and Clean Up**

```bash
kubectl delete deployment mynginx
kubectl delete service mynginx
minikube stop
minikube delete
```

* This deletes everything and stops Minikube.

---

# **PART 2: NAGIOS (Monitoring tool)**

### **Step 1: Pull Nagios Docker image**

```bash
docker pull jasonrivers/nagios:latest
```

---

### **Step 2: Run Nagios**

```bash
docker run --name nagiosdemo -p 8888:80 jasonrivers/nagios:latest
```

* Open browser: `http://localhost:8888`
* Login:

  * Username: `nagiosadmin`
  * Password: `nagios`

---

### **Step 3: Explore Dashboard**

* Click **Hosts** → See monitored systems
* Click **Services** → See CPU, memory, network
* Click **Alerts** → Notifications about issues

---

### **Step 4: Stop & Remove Nagios**

```bash
docker stop nagiosdemo
docker rm nagiosdemo
docker rmi jasonrivers/nagios:latest
```

---

# **EXAM TIPS**

1. **Minikube:**

   * Start → Deploy → Scale → Expose → Access → Delete.
   * Practice **each command once**, remember order.

2. **Nagios:**

   * Pull → Run → Login → Explore → Stop.
   * Remember ports: `8888` for web interface.

3. **Common Errors:**

   * Pod stuck → `kubectl describe pod <podname>` / `kubectl logs <podname>`
   * Nagios web error → Check container: `docker ps` / `docker logs nagiosdemo`

---

If you want, I can make a **“Copy-Paste Exam Command Sheet”** where you just **copy each command in order** for **Minikube and Nagios**, with **expected outputs**, so you can literally finish the lab in **10–15 minutes** without thinking.

Do you want me to make that?
